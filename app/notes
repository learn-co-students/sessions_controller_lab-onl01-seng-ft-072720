Introduction
Our app will have two pages:

- A home page or root route.
- If the user is not logged in, the page should show them a login link.
- If the user is logged in, the page should say, "hi, #{name}", and provide a logout link.
- A login page
- Users can enter their name in a form and click 'login'. Thereafter, the app will refer to them by that name.
- If the user does not enter a name, they are not logged in. Return them to the login page.
